## Technical Challenges
Trying to do a website using Node.Js, Express.Js, and MongoDB was a bit challenging considering that i hadn't studied them before but thankfully it went well and learned about new packages that facilitates the workflow too.

The other thing was making sure the data from database retrieved perfectly; because i got the data saved at the database but wasn't showing up when i try to access it through the frontend.
